                Hello, my name is Asafati Gea. I want to tell you about my work during the last long holiday from 28/04/2024 to
                21/08/2024. My work address is (Jl. Kolonel Masturi No.288, Villa Istana Bunga, Cihanjuang Rahayu, Parongpong, West
                Bandung Regency, West Java 40559, Indonesia).
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                During these 4 months, I worked as a Customer Support at socialvps and trading brokers. My working hours were 8 hours
                every day with occasional overtime. Additionally, I also worked in strawberry farming and carpentry, including repairing
                broken toilets, which often led to overtime.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                My experience as a socialVPS customer service over these 4 months has given me the confidence to speak with customers.
                My typing speed improved, reaching 69 WPM, and I learned effective time management due to the responsibilities of
                socialVPS CS and additional tasks.
            </p>
